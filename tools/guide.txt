To assemble a rule and check it for compatability with the existing rules:

pipe a set of rules into mal-intel-check.sh

To add intel:

Create the rule and check it against the existing rule corpus for
compatibility by calling intelcheck.sh
(run intelcheck.sh -h for correct usage)

If intelcheck doesn't complain, use intelwrite.sh
(again, run intelwrite.sh -h for usage) to produce the new intel
lines, and append them to /opt/bro/feeds/local.intel.
